## Linear Regression to predict MPG 

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle length and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts to a linear model.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a significant relationship between MPG and vehicle length/ground clearance. 

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the r-squared value is .7149. The p-value (5.35e-11) is also significantly less than .05. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis which states that the slope is equal to zero. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

In total, the current manufacturing data does meet this design specification because the mean variance is 59.57837 which is less than 100. Individually, lot 3 does not meet the design specification because of a variance of 178.7351.

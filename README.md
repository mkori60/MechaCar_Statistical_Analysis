## Linear Regression to predict MPG 

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle length and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts to a linear model.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a significant relationship between MPG and vehicle length/ground clearance. 

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the r-squared value is .7149. The p-value (5.35e-11) is also significantly less than .05. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis which states that the slope is equal to zero.
